# Trajectory-Generation-using-Inverse-Kinematics
Handled singularities by using different working modes to generate trajectories using Inverse Kinematics

Use of four working modes to handle the singularities of the parallel robot manipulator
The code generates some basic trajectory shapes mainly to demonstrate that by switching working modes, type 2 singularities can be effectively handled
